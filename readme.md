# Express To-Do-Project
## On the project
This project's purpose is to better acquaint myself with Node.js, Express, JSON, and eventually, perhaps, even MongoDB, by creating a To-Do-App which allows the user to add and remove tasks, which are then stored on the server. 
Once I have everything in place and I've proven that the basic functionalities work as intended using JSON, I will begin looking into the possibility of transitioning onto MongoDB.

Above all else this is a learning project for myself and I am interested and excited to see how I'll develop over the course of the project.

## Status
Very much in development
